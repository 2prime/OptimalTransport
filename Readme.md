# Convex Optimization Autumn 2017 Project

This is a repository of a project of the course *Convex Optimization* in Autumn 2017 by Jikai Hou, Zeyu Jia and Zhihan Li (lexicographically). [Course site](http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~wenzw/opt-2017-fall.html).

The midterm report and final report are respectively midterm.tex (midterm.pdf) and final.tex (final.pdf) in the `Reports` folder. The `Codes` folder contains codes, and the `Raw` folder contains some raw datium.

All codes are written in .ipynb files. To rerun the codes, you may use `Codes/environment.yml` to create a anaconda environment, and then use `make generate_all` to generate all .py files, and use `make test_all` to test the .py files.
